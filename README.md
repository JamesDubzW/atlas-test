# Atlas of Honest Entrances — Look & Feel

**Tone:**  
Calm, editorial, atlas-like — designed like a field or museum document.  
Sober, steady typography and generous white margins.

**Typography:**  
- Headings & marginalia → *Antiquarian Scribe* (Adobe Fonts)  
- Body text & captions → *Source Serif 4* (Google Fonts)

**Colour palette:**  
- Accent (ochre): `#C09C59`  
- Text (graphite): `#222222`  
- Rule (faint graphite): `#CFCFCF`  
- Paper background: `#FAFAF7`

**Layout principles:**  
- 10-column grid feeling; generous whitespace  
- Consistent small-caps figure titles and numbered plates  
- Provenance, Method, Notes in calm, neutral blocks  
- Thin graphite dividers  
- Subtle hover underline or colour shift on links  

**Marginalia (rotate through):**  
“Observed; no conclusion.” • “Coverage incomplete — by design.” • “Handle the blank with care.”
